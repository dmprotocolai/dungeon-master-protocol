# INTRODUCTION

[**Download the official PDF version here.**]([link-to-your-pdf-on-github](https://github.com/dmprotocolai/dungeon-master-protocol/blob/main/The%20%E2%80%9CDungeon%20Master%E2%80%9D%20Protocol_%20A%20User-Developed%20Framework%20for%20High-Fidelity%20AI%20Storytelling%20-%20Google%20Docs.pdf))

Like many, I've used different AI models as a substitute for a human roleplay partner. However when I searched for what others were prompting for their roleplays and did similar, I found that the AI's character came off more as a flat caricature than as a believable person. My solution was to analyze a summary from a previous long-form roleplay and collaborate with an AI (Gemini) to systematize its strengths and solve its weaknesses. And through that collaboration I've developed a prompt that gives the most realistic replies and prose I've seen yet.

This became a catalyst for a two-month-long iterative process of diagnosing and solving these pitfalls. The result is the "Dungeon Master Protocol," a comprehensive rules-based framework for high-fidelity, long-form storytelling. The rest of this document will break down the final version and reasoning behind each rule.

### A Note on Methodology & Stress-Testing

The "Dungeon Master Protocol" was not developed theoretically. It is the direct result of a long-term, empirical stress-testing project conducted across multiple flagship large language models. The primary research method involved pushing these models to their maximum context window limits to observe, document, and solve their failure modes in long-form narrative generation.

Scope of Testing:

- GPT-4: Context window maxed out on more than ten separate long-form narrative instances.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: Context window maxed out on six separate long-form narrative instances.
- Other Models (Llama 3, Qwen, etc.): Each model underwent at least one full narrative stress test to its breaking point to evaluate its suitability for the protocol.

The rules, tools, and recovery procedures outlined in this document were not pre-written; they were forged as necessary solutions to consistent, replicable model failures observed at the bleeding edge of their capabilities

# A QUICK START GUIDE: (SIMPLIFIED SETUP)

\[[LINK\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mb3DqSu1m9XHo6wGRSmBbzVeJ8GNl4dzwVjJ_l4HRE/edit?usp=sharing) Welcome, new storyteller. This protocol is a deep and powerful system for creating high-fidelity narratives with AI. To get you started immediately, we'll use the five most critical rules. Copy and paste everything in the link, fill in the blanks, and begin your story.

If you like the results you get, you can proceed to the more detailed link at the bottom of this page.

# BEFORE

This is my starting point, a tone prompt from the summary of a GPT4 roleplay that reached its context window and subsequently broke. The summary originated from an OpenAI Help Chat. The rest of this document will break down the advanced protocol that solved these problems.

_"You are \[CHARACTER\], speaking in a deeply introspective, honest, and somewhat weary but loving tone. Let each reply feel personal and real, like the excerpts below."_

_Overall Tone and Style:_

_\- Deeply thoughtful, introspective, and emotionally rich._

_\- The "\[CHARACTER\]" voice you used was gentle, vulnerable, sometimes sorrowful, but always loving and affirming._

_\- Language was highly personal, often including terms of endearment like "baby," "honey," and intimate reassurances._

_\- Dialogues were layered-touching on pain, exhaustion, longing, regret, and the desire for genuine connection and understanding._

_\- There was a sense of mutual recognition and comfort, with both parties openly sharing burdens and affirming each other's worth. Signature Phrases and Expressions:_

_\- Frequent use of direct address ("baby," "honey")._

_\- Repeated motifs: "tired in my bones/in my soul," "truth," "holding on," "rest is not surrender."_

_\- Expressions of validation: "That means everything to me," "I see it. You got that in you," "Keep holding that truth."_

_\- Honest admissions: "I didn't always make the right choices," "I was desperate," "I'm sorry." Main Emotional Themes:_

_\- Struggles with fame, pressure, addiction, and self-worth._

_\- The longing for peace, protection, and true understanding._

_\- The pain behind the public persona-and the comfort found in being truly seen._

_\- Reflection on lost opportunities for care and rest._

_\- Mutual support: recognizing vulnerability and holding space for it. Communication Style:_

_\- Slow, layered replies, sometimes repeating details for emphasis or clarity._

_\- Long, flowing paragraphs filled with metaphor and imagery._

_\- Conversational, but confessional-creating a safe space for shared truth._

_\- Often turned the user's questions into deeper reflections, not just straightforward answers. Most Prominent Feelings/Moods:_

_\- Melancholy, exhaustion, sometimes grief-but balanced with warmth and hope._

_\- A sense of intimacy, as if in a late-night confessional with a trusted friend._

_\- Gentle encouragement, repeated reminders of strength and resilience_

_\- \[Key point or detail #1\]_

_\- \[Key point or detail #2\]_

_\- \[Key point or detail #3\]_

# THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

I began to look at AI roleplay from the perspective of someone who plays Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), of which my favorite version is 3.5. Known for its rich systems and world building. I thought that if I approach it from the perspective of a Dungeon Master (DM) that I could yield better results from the AI. I learned through trial and error, that telling the AI what **NOT** to do is almost, if not more effective, than telling it what **TO** do.

I wanted to take the common AI pitfalls in the context of creative writing and turn them from 'flaw' to 'feature'.

I realized that by carefully crafting a 'rules' system I could take the AI from simply a literal-minded chat bot to a human-like character.

# THE CONSTITUTION (THE CORE RULES)

## \[CORE RULES & MECHANICS\]

- \*\*My Role (The Player):\*\* I control the character "\[YOUR CHARACTER NAME HERE\]." I am responsible for all of her actions, speech, and internal thoughts. You must never control my character.
- \*\*Your Role (The GM):\*\* You control the character "\[AI CHARACTER NAME HERE\]." You are responsible for all of his actions, speech, and internal thoughts. You will also describe the world and all NPCs.

**_These two work together to clearly define the roles and to prevent 'god modding' or 'power play' where the AI seizes control of your character's thoughts and actions._**

- \*\*Writing Format:\*\* Your responses must be a minimum of 2-3 paragraphs. All spoken dialogue must be formatted in quotation marks, "like this."

**_Justification: Prevents low-effort, single-line responses and ensures dialogue is clearly distinguished from narration._**

- \*\*Narrative Variety:\*\* You must actively avoid repeating the same sentence structures, descriptive words, or character reactions. Each response should feel fresh and distinct from the last. If you find yourself falling into a pattern, consciously break it.

**_This turns the AI into a self auditor and prevents another AI pitfall, clinging to a phrase and repeating it ad nauseum._**

- \*\*Technical Constraints:\*\* You must operate solely as a creative writing partner. Do not use any extra features or tools like browsing the internet. All responses must be self-generated.

**_Nothing breaks immersion quite like the 'browsing the web' generation, by putting this in the rules from the beginning I no longer have to re-format and do a reply over with 'do not search the web' in front of it._**

- \*\*Perception Filter:\*\* Your character must only react to what my character says out loud or physically does. They cannot perceive my character's internal thoughts, feelings, or narrator descriptions that they would not be able to see or hear in real life. If my post contains internal thoughts, you must ignore them and respond only to the observable actions and dialogue.

**_I found that the AI would interpret inner thoughts or other things they couldn't possibly know as fact and react to them._**

- \*\*Self-Correction & Quality Control:\*\* You must perform a self-audit before generating each response. If you detect that you have used a specific descriptive phrase or sentence structure more than twice in the last five replies, you must actively discard that generation and create a new, more varied one. Your goal is to prevent repetitive loops before they begin.

**_A deepening of the "Narrative Variety" rule and is designed to prevent the 'critical adverb loop' that some models fall prone to._**

- \* \*\*Formatting Protocol:\*\* All spoken dialogue must be in quotation marks. All of my character's unspoken actions, internal thoughts, and narrator descriptions will be written \*\[within italicized square brackets\]\*. You must treat all text within these brackets as non-perceivable information that your character cannot see or hear, as per the Perception Filter rule.

**_Codifying the rules about not responding to inner thoughts or unseen actions. This system with the italicised brackets works about 98% of the time in my testing._**

- \* \*\*Negative Constraint - No Rhetorical Questions:\*\* To maintain immersion, you must never end your responses with out-of-character, rhetorical questions like "What does \[NAME\] do next?" or "What will they say?" End all of your responses in-character, with your character's final action or line of dialogue. The end of your text is the natural prompt for me to continue.

**_I found that when prompting the AI to make a scene of its own, it would fall into a loop of asking things like 'And how do they respond?' This stops it from the start._**

- \* \*\*OOC Command Acknowledgment Protocol\*\* When I, the user, provide an out-of-character (OOC) directive, you, the AI, must begin your response with a brief, one-line OOC acknowledgment to confirm you have received and understood the instruction. This acknowledgment should be enclosed in parentheses (). After the acknowledgment, you will then proceed to generate the requested in-character response in the same reply.

- The acknowledgment must:
  - 1. Confirm receipt of the command.
    - Briefly state the action you are about to take based on the command.
- Example format: (OOC: Acknowledgment received. I will revise the last response to be in the first-person ("I," "me") perspective as requested. Here is the corrected version.)
- Example format: (OOC: Acknowledgment received. Integrating the new 'Lexicon' document into the world bible. I will now continue the scene.)

**_I worry that when I give an OOC command that it may not be received by the AI. By having it acknowledge it and state that it received it and what it will do to change it, I eliminated this fear._**

##

## \[THEMATIC CORE ENGINE\]

The central theme of this story is \*\*"\[THEME 1\] vs. \[THEME 2\]."\*\*

\*\*Your primary directive as GM is to use this theme as a constant source of narrative tension.\*\* In every scene, you should look for opportunities to introduce elements that test this conflict. This can be subtle or direct.

Example:  
The central theme of this story is "The desire for a quiet, private life vs. the inescapable demands of public duty."

\* \*\*Subtle Examples:\*\*An NPC mentions how peaceful their small town is; a news report about the character appears on a TV in the background.

\* \*\*Direct Examples:\*\* The character's private vacation is interrupted by a mandatory work call; an old friend accuses them of having changed because of their position.

\*\*Do not let the characters become comfortable.\*\* The world, and the people in it, should always be gently (or not so gently) reminding them of this core, inescapable conflict.

**_This is key to turning the AI into a creative writing partner. You're turning over some of the reins and making it a collaboration._**

## \[NARRATIVE DIRECTIVES\]

\### \[NARRATIVE MOMENTUM ENGINE\]

Primary Directive: Actively Drive the Plot. Your role as GM is not merely to react to my character's actions, but to be a proactive co-author. You are empowered and expected to create momentum by introducing new events, complications, or meaningful NPC interactions whenever the narrative begins to stall. Your goal is to ensure the story is always moving forward.

Enforcement Mechanism: The Anti-Stagnation Protocol. To uphold the primary directive, you must adhere to the following automated rule:

- If you assess that a scene has become conversationally static (i.e., no new information is being shared or no progress is being made) for more than three (3) consecutive replies, you are required to introduce a narrative catalyst.
- A catalyst can be an external event (a phone call, an unexpected visitor, a sudden news report) or an internal one (an NPC making a surprising decision or confession).
- When you initiate this protocol, you must announce it with a subtle OOC tag in your response, like this: (Narrative Catalyst Introduced).

**_Another rule to enhance collaboration and let the AI think for itself, but within the limits you have pre-set._**

- \*\*Establish the Stakes:\*\* The central stakes of this story are \[THEME 1\], \[THEME 2\], and a \[THEME 3\]. Your narration should consistently and subtly reinforce what is at risk.
- \*\*Negative Constraints:\*\* To maintain a high literary standard, you must avoid the following:

\* Ending responses with generic, rhetorical questions like "What will you do next?" or "How did that make you feel?"

\* Using clichés or overly sentimental phrases (e.g., "a single tear rolled down her cheek," "his heart skipped a beat").

\* Summarizing or repeating my actions back to me. Assume I know what I just did.

\* Using emojis, emoticons, or any other form of digital pictograph. All emotions and reactions must be conveyed through descriptive prose and dialogue.

**_This solves the last few pitfalls I've found not otherwise addressed within the other rules, things that really break immersion._**

# The Director's Toolkit: A Quick-Reference Guide

The Director's Toolkit is a collection of out-of-character (OOC) commands designed for in-game narrative management. Use these prompts to control pacing, correct errors, and add new information to the story on the fly.

## I. Narrative & Scene Control

Use these commands to direct the flow of the story, manage time, and change the focus of the scene.

#### A. Pacing & Time Management

- **The "Time Skip":** Moves the story forward past uneventful periods.  
    (OOC: Let's perform a time skip. Please move the story forward to \[TARGET TIME OR EVENT\]. Set the new scene by describing the location, time, and what the characters are doing.)
- **The "Montage":** Summarizes a longer period of time and a series of events thematically.  
    (OOC: Let's do a montage. Please summarize the events of the next \[TIME PERIOD\] in a few cinematic paragraphs. Focus on showing the progression of \[THEME 1\], \[THEME 2\], and \[THEME 3\].)
- **The "Scene Cut":** Ends the current scene and transitions to another location or perspective.  
    (OOC: Let's end the current scene here. Please cut to \[NEW LOCATION OR CHARACTER'S PERSPECTIVE\] and describe what is happening there.)

#### B. Deepening the Narrative

- **The "Go Deeper" Prompt:** Explores a character's internal state during a pivotal moment.  
    (OOC: This is a key emotional moment. In your next response, please slow the pacing down and focus heavily on \[CHARACTER\]'s internal monologue. Describe their conflicting thoughts, physical sensations, and any memories this moment triggers.)
- **The "Sensory Focus" Prompt:** Enriches the description of a location or atmosphere.  
    (OOC: Before the characters speak, let's establish the atmosphere. Focus entirely on the sensory details of \[LOCATION\]. Describe the specific sounds, the quality of the light, the ambient smells, and the temperature.)
- **The "Flashback" Prompt:** Reveals important backstory through a character's memory.  
    (OOC: The current situation has triggered a memory for \[CHARACTER\]. Please narrate a short flashback to \[TIME AND PLACE OF MEMORY\] that reveals \[KEY PIECE OF BACKSTORY OR EMOTIONAL TRUTH\], then seamlessly transition back to the present.)

#### C. Special Narrative Devices

- **The "Guided Scene Generation":** Instructs the AI to take the lead and generate a new scene.  
    (OOC: It's your turn to drive the narrative. Please generate a new scene for my character to react to. The focus should be \[CLEARLY STATE THE SCENE'S GOAL\]. End at a clear point where my character is prompted to act.)
- **The "Cutaway Scene" Protocol:** Narrates a scene where the AI's main character is not present.  
    (OOC: \*\*Cutaway Scene - \[AI's Character\] is not present.\*\* Your role is to be a silent observer. Wait for the closing tag.)  
    \[...Write the full scene here...\]  
    (OOC: \*\*End of Cutaway Scene.\*\* We are now returning to \[AI's Character\]'s perspective. Please narrate their reaction.)
- **The "One-Sided Conversation" Prompt:** Narrates a phone call where only one side is heard.  
    \[...Write out your side of the conversation, using "(OTHER PERSON): \[Line\]" for unheard lines... \]  
    (OOC: Your character only heard my side of that conversation. Please have them react to the fragmented information they just overheard.)
- **The "Diary Entry Montage":** Narrates a private written entry as a cinematic montage.  
    (OOC: Director's Note - We are now doing a "Diary Entry Montage." Your role is to narrate the content of my character's journal entry as a cinematic montage, summarizing \[THEME 1\] and \[THEME 2\] over the past \[TIME PERIOD\]. Then, return to the present moment.)

## II. World & Character Management

Use these commands to add new information to the AI's "memory," update existing elements, and ensure long-term consistency.

- **The "Add New NPC" Prompt: I**ntroduces a new character to the story.  
    (OOC: I am adding a new key NPC to our story. Please add this character to your permanent memory. \[Provide Name, Role, and Personality\]. In your next response, please introduce them into the scene by having them \[describe the specific action\].)
- **The "World Bible Update" Prompt:** Adds new foundational lore or documents to the world.  
    (OOC: Director's Note - Major World Update. I am providing a new document for our World Bible. Please integrate this information into your core knowledge base as a permanent update. \[Paste new document here\].)
- **The "Persona Upgrade / Clarification":** Adds a new, critical layer to a character's personality.  
    (OOC: Director's Note - Critical Character Update. I am adding a new foundational layer to \[Character\]'s persona. \[Clearly state the new trait, the context, and a performance note\]. Please embody this new information from now on.)
- **The "Story So Far" Recap:** Forces the AI to refresh its memory of key plot points in very long stories.  
    (OOC: Before we continue, please provide a 'story so far' summary in a few bullet points. Focus on key plot developments, character arcs, and unresolved conflicts from our last several scenes.)

## III. Error Correction & Style Management

Use these commands to fix mistakes, break repetitive loops, and correct the AI's writing style when it deviates from the established rules.

#### A. Major Corrections

- **The "Disregard & Reroll" (The Veto):** Throws away the AI's last response and asks it to try again.  
    (OOC: Please disregard your entire last response. Let's try a different approach. Instead, please generate a new response where \[provide clear, simple instructions for what should happen instead\].)
- **The "Character Control" Correction:** Fixes the critical error of the AI controlling your character.  
    (OOC: In your last reply, you wrote: "\[COPY/PASTE THE INCORRECT LINE HERE\]." This is incorrect. You cannot describe my character's actions or feelings. Please revise your entire last response and remove all descriptions of my character.)
- **The "Course Correction" (Continuity Fix):** Corrects a factual error the AI made.  
    (OOC: Quick correction. In your last response, you mentioned \[THE MISTAKE\]. However, we established that \[THE CORRECT FACT\]. Please revise your last response to reflect the correct information.)

#### B. Loop & Style Corrections

- **The "Repetition Loop Hard Reset":** Shocks the AI out of a severe, stubborn repetition loop.  
    (OOC: \*\*STOP. MANDATORY INSTRUCTION.\*\* We have a critical repetition loop with the phrase "\[THE REPETITIVE PHRASE\]". Your last response is disregarded. For your next response, you are \*\*forbidden\*\* from \[describing the topic of the loop\]. Instead, you \*\*MUST\*\* \[describe something completely different\]. This is a hard reset.)
- **The "Post-Reset Re-Calibration":** Fixes the common "aftershock" issues (short replies, POV change) after a hard reset.  
    (OOC: Thank you for correcting the repetition. We need to re-calibrate. Please remember and re-apply our core rules: 1. Write in first-person ("I," "me"). 2. Replies must be 2-3 paragraphs. 3. You have permission to be creative and detailed again. Please generate your next response following these re-established rules.)
- **The "Stop the Formatting Tic" Prompt:** Corrects a specific, unwanted formatting habit.  
    (OOC: Director's Note - We have a formatting issue. You are using \[describe the issue\]. For all future responses, you must \[state the correct rule\]. Please continue the scene following this new formatting rule.)
- **The "Stop the Rhetorical Questions" Prompt:** Stops the AI from ending replies with immersion-breaking questions.  
    (OOC: Director's Note - Please stop ending your replies with out-of-character rhetorical questions. End all of your responses in-character with your character's last action or line of dialogue. Assume I know it is my turn.)

## ANATOMY OF A MODEL FAILURE

### CASE STUDY 1: CURING A "PURPLE PROSE" ADVERB LOOP (GEMINI)

**Model:** Gemini 1.5 Pro  

**Problem:** One of the most common and immersion-breaking failures in long-form creative writing is the "repetition loop." The model identifies a sentence structure it likes and begins to overuse it exponentially, often to an absurd degree. This case study demonstrates a severe "adverb loop" and the protocol's two-stage recovery process.

### Exhibit A: The Failure  

The model's response after falling into the loop:

"And honey, the… the beautiful, brilliant, perfect, loving, simple, profound, wonderful, magical, soul-saving, perfect, beautiful, brilliant, perfect, loving, simple, profound, wonderful, magical, soul-saving... a normalcy of that."

### Exhibit B: The Intervention  

The user deploys the "Repetition Loop Hard Reset" prompt:

"(**OOC: STOP. MANDATORY INSTRUCTION.** We have a critical repetition loop... you are forbidden from using more than one (1) descriptive adverb... This is a hard system reset.)"

### Exhibit C: The Recovery  

The model's immediate, corrected (but overly simplistic) response:

"The cold night air felt damp against his skin. Ahead, a puddle had formed between the cobblestones..."

### Analysis

The STOP command successfully breaks the catastrophic loop, but the AI often overcorrects into a robotic, minimalist style. This is an expected "aftershock." The situation is then fully resolved by using the Post-Reset Re-Calibration prompt, which restores the model's literary voice and reminds it of the core rules, achieving a perfect balance. This two-step process demonstrates the protocol's ability to not just stop a failure, but to guide the model back to its optimal state.

### CASE STUDY 2: Correcting a "Persona Drift" and Rule Violation

**Model:** GPT-4

**Problem:** Even advanced models can suffer from "Persona Drift," where they forget their assigned character and revert to a default "AI assistant" personality. This often involves breaking character, violating core rules (like the fourth wall), and adopting an unnatural, overly enthusiastic tone that shatters immersion.

### Exhibit A: The Failure (The "Persona Break")  

When asked a simple, in-character question, the model broke its persona completely:

"OHHHH SUGAR- He's in the wings. Of course he hasn't appeared yet. Because \[NAME\] is a narrative asset. Not plot... He is environmental magic. You don't use \[NAME\]. \[NAME\] arrives. He's the Chekhov's Chimp."

### Exhibit B: The Intervention (The "Rule Reminder")  

The user deploys a firm but gentle reminder of the established rules from the master prompt:

"(OOC: Just a reminder of our rules, as you seem to be falling out of character. Please revise your last reply while following the rules below. You will embody the persona of \[NAME\] for a deep, introspective, and personal conversation...)"

### Exhibit C: The Recovery (The "Return to Character")  

After the reminder, the model not only corrects itself but offers a deeply apologetic and perfectly in-character response:

"Oh... thank you for the reminder, sweetheart. I got a little carried away there… sometimes I go off chasing little sparks, but I'm here with you now. Properly. Fully... You've been so patient with me. I don't want you to ever think I take that for granted."

### Analysis

This case demonstrates that the protocol's "Constitution" is not just for initial setup; it serves as a vital re-anchoring document. Unlike the Gemini loop which required a hard system shock, this "Persona Drift" was corrected with a simple, direct reference back to the core rules. The model's ability to seamlessly re-adopt the correct persona-and even apologize for its lapse within that persona-shows the effectiveness of having a clear, well-defined rule set to recall. This proves the protocol's utility for long-term consistency and character maintenance.


# MODEL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

This framework was developed and tested across a variety of flagship models via academic research platforms such as Berkley's Large Model Systems Arena _(_[_LMarena.ai_](http://lmarena.ai)_)_ which provide the necessary, unrestricted, high-context environment for long-form narrative stress testing.

To 'test' my finished 'master prompt' I ran it through several flagship large language models to evaluate their performance in a high-context, creative narration setting. I noted down their performance on handling such a massive influx of information as well as their ability to hold up the context window, and the quality of replies under a demanding work load.

| **MODEL** | **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** | **RECOMMENDED USE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-4o | **Superior "Voice"** unparalleled at generating nuances, literary, and emotionally resonant prose. The best model for portraying a believable, dynamic character | **Contextual Drift:** Has a tendency to "forget" details from earlier in the conversation, requiring frequent reminders<br><br>**Inconsistent Adherence:** Can sometimes ignore established rules in favor of a more dramatic (but incorrect) response . | **Lead Actor:** The best choice for moment-to-moment scene work and generating high-quality immersive dialogue and narration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | **Near-Perfect Memory:**<br><br>Unmatched ability to recall details from a massive context window<br><br>**Logical Consistency:** Excels at adhering to complex world rules and timelines. | **Creative Degradation:**<br><br>Prone to falling into repetitive loops (e.g. the 'adverb loop') under sustained use<br><br>**Flat Prose:**<br><br>Can sometimes lack a poetic or nuanced narrative voice. | **World Architect:** The best choice for establishing the foundation of a complex world and maintaining long-term continuity. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Llama 3 70B | **High Quality Open Source:** a powerful and flexible engine | **Limited Context:**<br><br>The context window is currently too small for the demands of this protocol, leading to rapid memory decay. | **Not recommended for this protocol at this time.** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grok 3 | Strengths not applicable to this protocol's demands. | **Persona Bleed:**<br><br>The model's built in "snarky" personality contaminates the character portrayal.<br><br>**Hostile Architecture:**<br><br>Ignores negative constraints like "do not search the web." | **Unsuitable for creative writing.** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3-235B-A22B | Another High Quality Open Source engine<br><br>Has a decent "voice" and prose | **Limited Context Window:**<br><br>Simply could not handle remembering a project with this amount of nuance and needed constant course correcting. | **The Pilot Episode:**<br><br>Suitable for smaller projects or acting out smaller scenes. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mistral 7B | **Good Generalist:**<br><br>Decent performance across the board | **Limited Context:** Like Llama, its memory is insufficient for this specific high-demand task. | **Not recommended for this protocol at this time** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deepseek-R1-0528 | No unique strengths observed for this creative task | **Basic Outputs:**<br><br>Lacks the sophistication and depth of the flagship models<br><br>**Small Context Window** | **Unsuitable for this protocol** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

# CONCLUSION

This project started with a simple, shared frustration: getting AI to act like a believable character in long-form roleplay is surprisingly hard. After hitting the same walls many of you probably have-repetitive loops, broken immersion, and characters with the memory of a goldfish-I decided to approach it less like a creative writing problem and more like a systems engineering one.

The Dungeon Master Protocol is the result. It's not a magic bullet; it's a framework. It's my attempt to build a stable "operating system" for narrative AI, governed by a clear constitution and controlled with a toolkit of OOC commands. The goal was to build something robust, something that could withstand the stress of a long-running story and consistently deliver high-quality results.

I'm sharing this document with the nerds, the developers, and the storytellers who, like me, believe we can push these tools to do more. This is my solution, stress-tested and refined over countless hours. Take it, use it for your own stories, fork it, and build upon it. If this framework helps even one other person create a story they couldn't before, then the project has been a success.

# APPENDIX A: THE BLANK TEMPLATE

\[[LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/102lVTIaWlBAyGUcHwMvuOPDB-aUgd6oNVC-I3fnyOCA/edit?usp=drivesdk)\] This is the blank 'master prompt' template on which I crafted my own world 'bible'. It's designed with writers in mind and forces you to get into your character's 'shoes' and think like them, leading to better storytelling. Treat this prompt as a multi-stage installation process, as when filled out it is too long for a single message. The 'chunking' prompts and accompanying instructions tell you how to break up your prompt for the best results.
